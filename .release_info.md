## New
- Add an error condition if the requested UPS name is not found in the NUT server on first scrape
- Debug logging will now log the names of valid UPSs found in the NUT server - search for `"UPS name detection"`

## Fixed
- Reolve a problem introduced in the previous release if the same UPS is scraped concurrently - thanks for the report in #27, @tsull360!

## Misc
- Efficiency: If no UPS name is provided in the scrape, but one is found when listing UPSs, save the name so future scrapes don't have to list UPSs again
- Cleanup: Make the code a bit more readable
